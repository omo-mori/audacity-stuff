metronome https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/rhythm_track.html

	1. use tempo tapper to find bpm https://www.musictheory.net/tools/tapper
	
	2. generate > rhythm track
	
	3. type in tempo (bpm)
	
	4. type in beats per bar (how many beats in 1 measure, ie set to 3 for 3/4)
	
	5. set number of bars (how many bars of the rhythm track you want to exist in total. ie, higher number for longer recordings/more room to record)
	
	6. this will generate a new track in audacity that will function as the metronome/click track. you can play to this when you want a metronome üëç


recording new track https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/playing_and_recording.html

	firstly, select where you'd like the recording to begin by clicking a particular spot on the timeline/audio track
	
	then, hold shift and press record
	
	this will start the recording at the place selected, and create a new track for said recording
	


remove latency https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/latency_test.html

	if experiencing latency:
	
	edit > preferences >devices tab
	
	set "latency compensation" to 0, keep "buffer length" the same
	


plug-ins (keep in mind the effect is only applied) https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects

	you cannot live monitor and real-time effects process at the same time
	
	meaning, you cannot tweak your guitar tone while live monitoring BEFORE you actually record
	
	the recording must already exist before you can use plug-ins to alter the sound/tone
	
	on the track you want to insert a plug-in onto, click "effects"
	
	click "add effect"
	
	select desired effect/plug-in from the menu
	
	the name of the plug-in should now appear in the "realtime effects" section, which should currently be on the left hand side of the screen
	
	click the plug-ins name to open the plug-in itself (user interface)
	
	loop playback of the section you're sound designing for, and tweak/play around with the plug-in üëç
